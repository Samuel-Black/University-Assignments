# CSCI317 - Database Performance Tuning - Final Project

## Scope
Tasks related to improving the performance of an Oracle database application.

## Limitations
* No more than an additional 100MB can be invested into transient memory.
* No more than an additional 300MB can be invested into persistent storage.

## Implemented optimizations include:
* Transformation of SELECT queries
* Creation of B*Tree and Bitmap indexes
* Allocational of additional transient memory into default cache
* Creation of 32k tablespace and rebuild of large B*Tree indexes

## Tasks
* Task 1 - SELECT statement used for power testing in TPC-HR benchmark: __6/6__
* Task 2 - SELECT statement used for power testing in TPC-HR benchmark: __6/6__
* Task 3 - SELECT statement using a stored function that never ends: __6/6__
* Task 4 - JDBC application: __6/6__
* Task 5 - JDBC application: __6/6__

Total marks awarded - __30/30__
